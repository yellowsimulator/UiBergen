I gratefully thanks my supervisor professor jarle Bertsen for the supports he had given me. His ability to see the bigger picture helped me tremendously in the process of writing this thesis. I want to also thank my colleague D.r Ru Yan with whom I had fruitful discussions, that was beneficial to this thesis.
