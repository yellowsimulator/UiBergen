\chapter*{Acknowledgment}
I am profoundly gratefully towards my supervisor professor jarle Berntsen, for the supports he had given me. His ability to see the bigger picture, coupled with a great sense of detail, was instrumental and necessary in the process of writing this thesis. I am also thankful for his life advice pertaining to health and good living in general. 
I want to also thank my colleague Dr Ru Yan with whom I had fruitful discussions, that was beneficial to this thesis.
