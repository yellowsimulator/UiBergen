\chapter*{Abstract}
Two methods for bearings fault detection are presented. Namely: Hilbert Huang transform and wavelet transform coupled with machine learning. Hilbert Huang transform is a data decomposition procedure, that uses local properties of a signal, to iteratively extract its sub-components. It deals with non-linearity and non-stationary with ease by design. It is coupled with a robust seasonal trend decomposition method, to extract high frequency short duration pulses, emitted by a crack located in the outer ring of a bearing. Wavelet transform on the other hand, uses a priori basis functions called wavelets, to decompose and reconstruct signals. It extracts both temporal and frequency information, and is able to \say{zoom in} and \say{zoom out} of data. The former and the latter properties are due to a scaling factor build in wavelet by design.
We coupled wavelet transform with support vector machine, which is a linear classification algorithm, to monitor and detect bearing defect for a system of four bearings.
