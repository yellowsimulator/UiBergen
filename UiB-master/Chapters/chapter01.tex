\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:introduction}
%The first chapter of a well-structured thesis is always an introduction, setting the scene with background, problem description, objectives, limitations, and then looking ahead to summarize what is in the rest of the report. 
%This is the part that readers look at first---\emph{so make sure it hooks them!}

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}
%In this section, you should present the problem that you are going to investigate or analyze; why this problem is of interest; what has, so far, been done to solve the problem, and which parts of the problem that remain.
%{\color{red}Below, I have set up some headings (subsection titles) without a number. 
%These are included to help you remember to cover the related issues. 
%The headings should be removed in your final print.}

%\subsection*{Problem Formulation}
In the associate press, one of the leading news organization, one could read: \say{Norwegian probe: Gearbox failure cause fatal 2016  crash}.
It was a news report of the crash of an airbus helicopter, on a small island outside of Bergen, the second largest city in Norway, cutting short the life of 13 people. The official cause of the crash: \say{A fatigue fracture in the main rotor gearbox.} [reference]. The question that arrises after such catastrophic event is: was the dram preventable?

Since the industrial revolution, engines and machines have been the driving force for economical growth across industries such as automotive, airline, oil and gaze, to name a few. However, machines are prone to failure and must be monitor and maintain regularly to avoid catastrophic failure, which can lead, inevitably, to human live and significant financial lost. 
\justify
To mitigate equipment and machines proclivity toward failure and the associated cost, a process called predictive maintenance has been developed within the industrial community. Predictive maintenance  for machines and industrial equipments can be defined as a maintenance philosophy or more generally a framework, with a set of standards and methods, used to predict and prevent machine failure in order to avoid unexpected downtime and reduce related human and financial cost. This maintenance philosophy, when correctly implemented, increases machine life time and reduce maintenance cost, by detecting as early as possible onset of failure and plan maintenance accordantly.
\justify
In rotating machines such as gearbox, more than $40 \% $ of failure can be attributed to bearing faults, as shown in figure \ref{fig:pie}, \cite{patidar13}. This might be due to the fact that they facilitate rotation movements under various load and can be subjected to significant and various mechanical forces. The most commonly used method in the industry to detect specific bearing faults is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The FFT method consists of transforming a vibration signal emanating from a bearing, to its corresponding frequency spectrum. If the bearing exhibits signs of failure, the frequency of the latter will be visible in the frequency spectrum. It is worth noting that, a bearing failure frequency is derived from the bearing geometry, and depends on the rotating speed of the machine.

\end{figure}
\justify
One of the drawback of the FFT method for bearing fault detection, among others, is the dependence of the failure frequency on the rotating speed of the machine. For constant rotating speed, it is straight forward to estimate the failure frequencies. However, when the rotating speed varies continuously, it becomes very challenging to estimate the failure frequencies accurately, and this can lead to incorrect fault diagnosis.
\justify
To circumvent the latter, many efforts have been directed toward alternative methods for bearing fault detection. In this thesis we focused on methods derived from Hilbert Huang transform, wavelet transform and machine learning. The attractiveness of these methods relies on the fact that, they do not require the bearing geometrical properties and the rotating speed of the machine to detect failure. 
\justify
Hilbert Huang transform was developed recently by  Huang, \cite{huang98} to deal efficiently with non linear and non stationary processes. It decomposes data adaptively 
into its elementary parts by using an a-priory basis functions. Unlike Fourier transform where trigonometric functions are used to decomposed signals, adaptive decomposition means that 
the basis functions are completely determined by the data itself, \cite{huang08}. This allows in theory, to access intrinsic and salient properties of data.
\justify
Wavelet transform is a signal analysis tool such as Fourier transform. In contrast to the latter, wavelets can be used to detect short duration hight frequency burst, \cite{albert09}.
Wavelets are family of functions generated by two functions: the so called mother wavelet and a scaling function. The scaling property allows a wavelet to zoom in, on short and high frequency pulses \cite{albert09},
such as tiny onset of cracks in bearings.
\justify
Machine learning methods commonly used are supervised and unsupervised learning methods. In supervised learning, an algorithm learns the pattern of instances of failure, in order to detect them in subsequent samples. It is however common that failure instances are not available or are too scarce to learn from. In that event, unsupervised learning algorithms are the alternative to supervised learning. The former algorithms, categorize data into different groups where data points in the same cluster share some sort of similarity.
\justify
 The application of the aforementioned methods for bearing failure detection have been studied by various researchers. 
To outline our contribution from what has been previously done, we present a literature survey in section \ref{sec:relatedwork}, followed by our contribution in section \ref{sec:contributions}. Since Fourier transform is the standard method applied to bearing fault detection across various industries, chapter \ref{sec:chapter2} shows how Fourier analysis is applied to bearing fault detection by using a concrete case study. This will serve as a reference with regards to Hilbert Huang transform, wavelet transform and machine learning methods.
\justify
Chapter \ref{sec:hht} and \ref{sec:waveletandsvm} cover the contribution of this work. In Chapter \ref{sec:hht}, we show how Hilbert Huang transform coupled with a robust seasonal decomposition, can detect high frequency and short duration pulses, generated by bearing faults. In chapter \ref{sec:waveletandsvm} we present a methodology to quantify bearings health and classify multiples bearings with wavelet transform and machine learning. Chapter \ref{sec:conclusion} presents the conclusion of the thesis through a summary, and pinpoint some of its limitations. To improve upon what we have done, we present a road map with suggestions.

\section{Contributions }
\label{sec:contributions}
The contribution of this work can be summed up in three. Firstly, We show that Hilbert Huang transform coupled with the robust seasonal trend estimation based of Loess [ref], can extract high frequency spikes emitted when bearing balls pass defect area or cracks.
\justify
secondly, We show that a bearing health can be estimated by a robust statistical dispersion measure: the interquartile range (IQR). We call the latter the health index. Furthermore,  the health index is used to estimate a bearing health trajectory. The health trajectory is the different stages a bearing can go through until failure occurs. We show that a bearing can go through three successive phases: The onset of failure, a rapid deterioration and an imminent failure phase. 
\justify
lastly, we estimated a health decision boundary for a system of bearings, based on a wavelet decomposition, the IQR, and a one class support vector machine. A health decision boundary allows for deciding if a bearing is about to fail or not. For each successive vibration signal, a discrete wavelet transform is used to decompose the vibration signal into two new features: The high and low frequency component. The health index of the high and low frequency components are computed. In this fashion, we obtain a set of points in the high and low frequency feature space. By training a one class support vector machine we can estimate a health decision boundary for multiple bearings.
