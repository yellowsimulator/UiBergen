# experimental hypothesis is that the yield is greater than 150 grams.
# thus, the statistical hypotheses are
# H0: mu <= 150, H1: mu > 150, 
# because this allows us to control the error of type I (via alpha), i.e. the probability of concluding that the yield is greater than 150, although in reality it is not 
t.test(barley, mu = 150, alternative = "greater")
# H0 can be rejected at level 10%, but not at 5%. so, keep your land, or lower the price

# 3.
t.test(barley, mu = 147, alternative = "two.sided")
# the null hypothesis can be rejected for an alpha of 10%. it could also be rejected for a level of 5% or 1% - but not 0.1%

# 4.
# the confidence interval is mentioned in the output.
# the result of the test can be directly deduced from the
# confidence band. For example:
t.test(barley, mu = 147, alternative = "two.sided",
       conf.level = 0.99)
t.test(barley, mu = 147, alternative = "two.sided",
       conf.level = 0.999)
# note that only the conf. interval a 99.9% includes the value 147. thus,
# the hypothesis of mean equal to 147 cannot be rejected for a given level
# alpha of 0.1% (0.0001)
       
# note that the assumption of normality should be tested
shapiro.test(barley)
hist(barley, breaks = 20)
# as this example shows, the normality hypothesis is rejected here. hence, the t-test was not the best choice here

# reading the data and "attaching" it
dat <- read.table("Partners.dat", header = TRUE)
attach(dat)

# visualization

# looking at the data set, the number of partners is count data. thus, it seems in principle quite unlikely that the assumption of a Gaussian distribution is satisfied
par(mfrow = c(2, 1))
hist(partners[sex == "m"], main = "Male particip.")
hist(partners[sex == "f"], main = "Female particip.")
# in particular the female group does not look Gaussian at all

# testing
shapiro.test(partners[sex == "m"])
shapiro.test(partners[sex == "f"])
# normality is clearly rejected for the female group. note that this is not the case for the male group, although the data are also counts. the reason is that count data can be approximately normally distriuted, and this is sufficient for not rejecting the normality hypothesis. in general, this is only the case if the data take a large number of different count values and are approximately symmetric (not skewed), i.e. they should "look normal"

# what would you tell your colleage apart from this?
# 1. were covariates taken into account? e.g. females could be very young, and males older, thus a bad experimental setup.
# 2. "self-report bias": honesty reduces when it comes to topics considered sensitive, e.g. sexual behaviour or diseases, wealth, drug use,...

# 2.
# First, recall the definition of a p-value. Several exist, e.g.:
#
# 1. In statistical significance testing, the p-value
# is the probability of obtaining a test statistic at
# least as extreme as the one that was actually
# observed, assuming that the null hypothesis is true.
#
# 2. For a statistical test, the p-value corresponds to the lowest possible 
# level of the test (the alpha) for which the null hypothesis can be rejected
# 
# The lower the p-value, the less likely the result is
# if the null hypothesis is true, and consequently
# the more "significant" the result is, in the
# sense of statistical significance.
# One often accepts the alternative hypothesis,
# (i.e. rejects a null hypothesis) if the p-value
# is less than 0.05 or 0.01, corresponding
# respectively to a 5% or 1% chance of rejecting
# the null hypothesis when it is true (type I error).
